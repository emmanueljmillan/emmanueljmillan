Sigma Biomedical is a <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">medical device testing</span> and <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">compliance</span> laboratory. We work with various clients across different product fields and integrate with their <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">product development</span>  and <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">regulatory consulting</span>  teams, benchmarking their products with existing predicates and evaluating them for safety and efficacy.

- Design and validate test protocols for acoustic, optical, and electrical safety testing for medical devices according to <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">ISO</span>  and <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">IEC</span>  standards (i.e. IEC 60601-1, ISO 8600-1, IEC 60601-2-37).
- Develop <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">MATLAB</span>  apps for signal processing, determination of waveform attenuation, and contrast function evaluation of images at various distances.
- Evaluate doppler sensitivity and measurement accuracy of intrathoracic catheters using <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">medical ultrasound</span> imaging systems.
- Research optical properties of endoscope camera systems, including contrast resolution, image intensity uniformity, and optimum working distance. Moreover, <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">spectroscopy</span>  is used to evaluate other parameters such as lux and absorbance.
- Perform device instrumentation and data analysis using equipment such as oscilloscopes, doppler ultrasound systems, spectroradiometers (SpectraWiz), and electrical safety analyzers.
