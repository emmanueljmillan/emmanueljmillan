Sigma Biomedical is a <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">medical device testing</strong> and <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">compliance</strong> laboratory. We work with various different clients across different product fields and integrate with their <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">product development</strong>  and <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">regulatory consulting</strong>  teams, benchmarking their products with existing predicates and evaluating them for safety and efficacy.

- Design and validate test protocols for acoustic, optical, and electrical safety testing for medical devices according to <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">ISO</strong>  and <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">IEC</strong>  standards (i.e. IEC 60601-1, ISO 8600-1, IEC 60601-2-37).
- Develop <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">MATLAB</strong>  apps for signal processing, determination of waveform attenuation, and contrast function evaluation of images at various distances.
- Evaluate doppler sensitivity and measurement accuracy of intrathoracic catheters using <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">medical ultrasound</strong>  imaging systems.
- Research optical properties of endoscope camera systems, including contrast resolution, image intensity uniformity, and optimum working distance. Moreover, <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">spectroscopy</strong>  is used to evaluate other parameters such as lux and absorbance.
- Perform device instrumentation and data analysis using equipment such as oscilloscopes, doppler ultrasound systems, spectroradiometers (SpectraWiz), and electrical safety analyzers.
