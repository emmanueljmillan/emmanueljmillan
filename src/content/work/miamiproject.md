The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis is a research center at the <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">University of Miami- Miller School of Medicine</span>, where efforts are made on understanding and finding new treatments for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury. Research areas include <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">neuroplasticity</span>, <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">neuroprotection</span>, <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">neuroregeneration</span>, <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">cell therapy</span>, <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">neural engineering</span>, among others. I am currently part of the <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">Neural Stem and Tissue Engineered Microenvironments (NeuSTEM)</span> research lab, with current efforts focused on engineered <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">nanoparticles</span>.

- Synthesize chondroitin sulfate nanoparticles (CS-NPs) and evaluate different fabrication parameters to optimize yield and surface charge through zeta scoring.
- Conduct <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">DMMB assays</span> to assess sulfation of PLGA-PEG-CS across low, medium, and high molecular weight formulations.
- Use aseptic technique to change cell culture media for <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">Schwann cell</span> and <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">fibroblast</span> cultures.
- Evaluate cell culture purity and conduct cell viability assays for Schwann cell cultures.
- Perform enzymatic depolymerization of chondroitin sulfate A, as well as ultrafiltration for fractionating into different molecular weights.
