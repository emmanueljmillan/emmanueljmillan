The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis is a research center at the <span class="font-semibold dark:font-bold dark:text-white">University of Miami- Miller School of Medicine</span>, where efforts are made on understanding and finding new treatments for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury. Research areas include <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">neuroplasticity</strong>, <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">neuroprotection</strong>, <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">neuroregeneration</strong>, <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">cell therapy</strong>, <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">neural engineering</strong>, among others. I am currently part of the <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">Neural Stem and Tissue Engineered Microenvironments (NeuSTEM)</strong> research lab, with current efforts focused on engineered <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">nanoparticles</strong>.

- Synthesize chondroitin sulfate nanoparticles (CS-NPs) and evaluate different fabrication parameters to optimize yield and surface charge through zeta scoring.
- Conduct <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">DMMB assays</strong> to assess sulfation of PLGA-PEG-CS across low, medium, and high molecular weight formulations.
- Use aseptic technique to change cell culture media for <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">Schwann cell</strong> and <strong class="text-highlight-light dark:text-highlight-dark">fibroblast</strong> cultures.
- Evaluate cell culture purity and conduct cell viability assays for Schwann cell cultures.
- Perform enzymatic depolymerization of chondroitin sulfate A, as well as ultrafiltration for fractionating into different molecular weights.
