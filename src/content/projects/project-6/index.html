Plan of action:
Continue on The Mu-trix Reloaded, The Mu-trix Revolutions, and The Mu-trix Resurrections. 
Mu-trix: Using EEG data to design model that optimizes training and validation accuracy for intent of movement.
Reloaded: Use Mu-trix model to feed in data and use output as input for .ino code. Can it move accordingly?
Revolutions: Use live data and evaluate accuracy and latency. Improve Mu-trix for more representative model for live data
Resurrections: Integrate revolutions as a prosthetic?
