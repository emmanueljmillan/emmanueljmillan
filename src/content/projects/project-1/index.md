Endoscope manufacturers must adhere to specific ISO standards governing image properties to ensure high-quality imaging and patient safety. The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) serves as a mathematical framework for quantifying how aberrations within a device impact image fidelity. CTF is calculated by assessing image contrast at discrete spatial frequencies. New products seeking FDA pre-market notification require demonstrating both ISO compliance and substantial equivalence- showing similar or significantly improved optical performance compared to a predicate device (a previously approved medical device with the same intended use).
